# Pega Notes

## Case Life Cycle

- A **Case Type** is an abstract model of a business transaction.
- A **Case** is a specific instance of the transaction

Cases are organised into **stages**, which contain **processes**, which contain individual **steps**.

Processes and steps are named using **verb + noun** naming convention.

It is best practice to break steps into other processes if you have more than 7 steps to a process.

Alternate stages can be used when a case deviates from the sunny day path. E.g a request is cancelled.

## Service level Agreements

**A service level agreement (SLA) establishes a deadline for work completion. This can range from an informal promise to negotiated contracts**.

There are 4 intervals in an SLA:

- Start
- Goal (occurs once)
- Deadline (occurs once)
- Passed Deadline (can repeat indefinitely)
