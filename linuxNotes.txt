# Linux Notes

* The '*' wildcard symbol looks for 0...* characters.

## Commands:

ls*.? - List any files with any char, and exactly 1 char after a dot. Useful for finding directories (e.g. folder.d)

more [A-Z]* - Echo the contents of any file in the current dir

ls /etc/[!a-m]* - List any folders (and their files) in the etc/ folder that don't include chars in the a-m range.

file /usr/bin/*x* - Reports the file type and symbolic links of all files in the directory /usr/bin/ that has an 'x' in the file name.

ls [a-z]*[0-9] - List all files that start with a lowercase letter and end in a number (Character case)

ls -l .[!.]* - List the contents of all hidden files and folders

ls -d /etc/*.d/* - List the contents of all directories with any name, a '.d' extension, and anything after that

## Character Classes
Locale independent
  * [[:lower:]] - matches any lower case char
  * [[:upper:]] - matches any upper case char
  * [[:alpha:]] - matches any lower or upper case char
  * [[:alum:]]  - matches any alphanumeric char
  * [[:punct:]] - matches any one of  " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~. chars
  * [[:digit:]] - matches 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

## INodes

An inode number points to an inode. This is a data structure that stores info about a file, such as:
  * Size
  * Device ID
  * User and Group ID
  * Access priveleges
  * File protection flags
  * Timestamps for creation, modification etc.
  * Link counter to determine no. of hard links
  * Pointers to the blocks containing the file's content

To find the inode type 'stat' <filename>

Files can be linked using inodes.

A hard link is a direct pointer to the inode of a file. A linked file points to the original and shares its' contents.

A symbolic link does the same, but the linked file stores the inode number of the origianl file.

You cannot link 2 existing files. To link a file, it must be created when you run the command to link it.

To link files, use the command 'ln' <file1> <file2>. Use the flag -s for a symblic link.

Use 'rm' to remove links. A file is deleted when all of its hard links are removed.

Using the 'history' command displays all commands entered in numerical order. To rerun a command, type '!<number>'. To run a command that you ran x number of commands ago, use '! -n', where n is the number you want.

Typing '!!' runs the last command.

Typing '!some prefix' runs the last command found with the specified prefix. e.g. '!ca' runs the last cat command found.

Running '^xx^yy' runs the last command with xx replaced with yy.
Running '!n:s/xx/yy' runs the command at the nth line, with xx replaced by yy.
Running '!*' displays all the arguments of the last command.
Running '!^' displays the first argument of the last command.
Running '!$' displays the last argument of the last command.
Running '!:n' displays the nth argument of the last commnad.

'set' displays all vars
'env' displays all exported vars
'unset' <var> deletes vars

'type'<program> displays where the program is located.

Use 'export -f <function name>' to export a function.

'set -o' displays shell options.
'set -o <option name>' sets an option to 'on'
'set +o <option name>' sets an option to 'off'

## Permissions

chmod, chown and chgrp change permissions.

'chown newOwner file' gives another user ownership of a file
'chown newOwner:group file' changes user and group ownership of a file

## Data Streams

echo "stuff" 1&2 > file - sends either output or errors to file
echo "stuff" > file 2> errorFile - sends both output and errors to files

echo stuff >| file ignores the 'noclobber' option. This allows you to overwrite the contents of a file when 'noclobber' is set to on.

the 'tee' command copies stdin to stdout. It must be surrounded by pipes | tee fileName |

Print out how many users are logged in, keep the list in a file, and output the line count to the terminal.
The -a flag appends output when writing to a file
who | tee -a who.list | wc -l

## Grep

grep -v otuputs non-mathced lines
grep -c outputs the count of matched lines
grep -i ignores case
grep -n gives lnie numbers to each result
grep -E allows for extended regular expressions (incorporating 'OR' functionality) | = 'OR'
e.g. cat file | grep "tesxt to find"

## Cut

This command removes sections from each line of files.
-d is a delimiter, the character that differentiates fields.
-f specifies the fields to select. e.g -f1,2,3 would return the first 3 fields
e.g cat file | cut -d "," -f1-3

## Uniq

Displays unique and non unique rows of data, only works if data is sorted so that unique data is grouped.

# Scripting

* Scripts must be made executable using the chmod +x command before it can be run.
