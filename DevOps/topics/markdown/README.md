## Overview
Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It's written in what people call 'plaintext'; this is just the regular alphabet, with a few symboles (such as `*` and `#`).

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.

Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, colour, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text, such as: making things bold, creating headers, organising lists, and much more.

## Usage
The best way to get better with Markdown is to use it! This can be done with any plaintext file, by using the `.md` or `.markdown` extension. You can either edit the files using an editor such as vim or nano, or use an online editor, such as the one found at <https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html>.

You will see Markdown used in GitHub `README.md` files, which are great for providing an introduction to a project, some install instructions, standards that need adhering to, etc.
